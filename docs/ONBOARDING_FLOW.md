# Onboarding Flow Implementation

## Overview

This implementation fixes the "argument username is missing" error by redirecting Google OAuth users to an onboarding page where they can set their username.

## Flow Description

1. **Google OAuth Sign-in**: User signs in with Google
2. **User Creation**: User is created in database with `onboarded: false`
3. **Onboarding Redirect**: User is redirected to `/onboarding` page
4. **Username Selection**: User chooses a username with real-time validation
5. **Profile Completion**: User is marked as onboarded and redirected to home

## Key Components

### 1. Onboarding Page (`/app/onboarding/page.tsx`)
- Beautiful, responsive UI with animations
- Real-time username validation
- Username availability checking
- Form validation with visual feedback

### 2. Updated NextAuth Configuration (`/app/api/auth/[...nextauth]/route.ts`)
- JWT callback checks database for onboarding status
- Session includes `onboarded` field
- Redirect logic handles onboarding flow

### 3. User API (`/app/api/auth/user/route.ts`)
- Handles username updates
- Updates `onboarded` status
- Creates/updates user profiles

### 4. Username Availability API (`/app/api/auth/check-username/route.ts`)
- Real-time username availability checking
- Validates username format
- Prevents duplicate usernames

### 5. Route Protection (Client-side)
- OnboardingGuard component handles route protection
- Client-side redirects to onboarding when needed
- Handles authentication state without middleware conflicts

## Database Schema

The user model includes:
```prisma
model User {
  id          String   @id @default(cuid())
  fullName    String
  username    String   @unique
  email       String   @unique
  provider    String   @default("email")
  onboarded   Boolean  @default(false)
  // ... other fields
}
```

## Validation

- Username format validation (3-30 characters, alphanumeric + ._-)
- Reserved word checking
- Real-time availability checking
- Visual feedback with icons and colors

## Error Handling

- Graceful error handling for API failures
- User-friendly error messages
- Fallback states for network issues
- Proper loading states

## Security

- Authentication required for all onboarding endpoints
- Session validation
- CSRF protection via NextAuth
- Input sanitization and validation

## Testing the Flow

1. Sign in with Google OAuth
2. Should be redirected to `/onboarding`
3. Enter a username and see real-time validation
4. Submit to complete onboarding
5. Should be redirected to home page

## Recent Improvements

### âœ… **Phase 3 Ready Features:**

1. **Client-side Route Protection** (`/components/OnboardingGuard.tsx`)
   - Protects routes from non-onboarded users
   - Handles authentication redirects properly
   - Includes onboarding status in session
   - Comprehensive route protection without middleware conflicts

2. **Enhanced Error Handling**
   - Retry mechanism with exponential backoff
   - Better error recovery and user feedback
   - LocalStorage error handling
   - Network failure recovery

3. **Improved User Experience**
   - Error display with retry options
   - Better loading states
   - Progress persistence across sessions
   - Comprehensive validation feedback

4. **Security Enhancements**
   - JWT-based authentication with onboarding status
   - Route protection for all sensitive pages
   - Proper session management
   - CSRF protection via NextAuth

## Testing

Run the test utility in browser console:
```javascript
testOnboardingFlow()
```

## Future Enhancements

- Profile picture upload during onboarding
- Additional profile fields (bio, location, etc.)
- Social media links
- Interests/topics selection
- Welcome tutorial
- A/B testing for onboarding flow optimization
