## 🛡️ **Protection Logic**

### **Authentication Flow**
```
User visits route:
├── Public route → ✅ Allow access
├── Auth route → ✅ Allow access
├── Protected route (no auth) → 🔄 Redirect to /auth/signin
├── Protected route (with auth) → Check onboarding status
│   ├── Needs onboarding → 🔄 Redirect to /onboarding
│   └── Onboarded → ✅ Allow access
└── Admin route → Check admin role
    ├── Is admin → ✅ Allow access
    └── Not admin → 🔄 Redirect to / (or show 403)
```

### **Onboarding Flow**
```
User completes onboarding:
├── Basic features → ✅ Available immediately
├── Content creation → ✅ Available after onboarding
├── Social features → ✅ Available after onboarding
├── Analytics → ✅ Available after onboarding
├── Monetization → 🔄 Requires additional verification
└── Admin features → 🔄 Requires admin role
```

## 🔐 **Security Considerations**

### **Route Protection Levels**

#### **Level 1: Public Access**
- No authentication required
- No user data access
- Static content only

#### **Level 2: Authentication Required**
- User must be logged in
- Basic user data access
- Account management features

#### **Level 3: Onboarding Required**
- User must be logged in AND onboarded
- Full feature access
- Content creation capabilities

#### **Level 4: Role-Based Access**
- User must have specific role/permissions
- Admin features
- Moderation capabilities

### **Additional Security Measures**

#### **Rate Limiting**
```typescript
// Routes that need rate limiting
const rateLimitedRoutes = [
  '/auth/signin',
  '/auth/signup',
  '/api/auth/*',
  '/create',
  '/edit/*'
]
```

#### **CSRF Protection**
```typescript
// Routes that need CSRF protection
const csrfProtectedRoutes = [
  '/account/delete',
  '/settings',
  '/create',
  '/edit/*'
]
```

#### **Content Validation**
```typescript
// Routes that need content validation
const contentValidationRoutes = [
  '/create',
  '/edit/*',
  '/profile/edit',
  '/messages/*'
]
```

## 📋 **Implementation Checklist**

## 🚀 **Best Practices**

### **1. Always Validate on Server Side**
- Client-side protection is for UX only
- Server-side validation is for security

### **2. Use Proper Error Handling**
- Don't expose sensitive information in errors
- Log security events for monitoring

### **3. Implement Proper Logging**
- Log authentication attempts
- Log access to sensitive routes
- Monitor for suspicious activity

### **4. Regular Security Audits**
- Review route protection regularly
- Test authentication flows
- Check for new vulnerabilities

### **5. User Experience**
- Clear error messages
- Smooth redirects
- Proper loading states
- Remember user's intended destination

## 🔧 **Configuration**

### **Environment Variables**
```env
# Authentication
NEXTAUTH_SECRET=your-secret-key
NEXTAUTH_URL=http://localhost:3000

# Rate Limiting
RATE_LIMIT_MAX=100
RATE_LIMIT_WINDOW=900000

# Security
CSRF_SECRET=your-csrf-secret
JWT_SECRET=your-jwt-secret
```

### **Middleware Configuration**
```typescript
// Add to middleware.ts
export const config = {
  matcher: [
    '/((?!api|_next/static|_next/image|favicon.ico).*)',
  ],
}
```

This comprehensive route protection strategy ensures that:
- ✅ Users can only access appropriate features
- ✅ Security is maintained at all levels
- ✅ User experience is smooth and intuitive
