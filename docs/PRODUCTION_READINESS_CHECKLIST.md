## üîß Still Needs Attention

### Backend Integration (High Priority)
- [ ] Replace sessionStorage/localStorage with real API calls
- [ ] Implement proper authentication
- [ ] Add database integration
- [ ] Set up proper error logging

### Environment Setup (Medium Priority)

- [ ] Configure production API endpoints
- [ ] Set up monitoring and analytics
- [ ] Configure CDN for static assets

### Testing (Medium Priority)
- [ ] Unit tests for critical functions
- [ ] Integration tests for API calls
- [ ] E2E tests for user flows
- [ ] Performance testing

### Monitoring (Low Priority)
- [ ] Error tracking (Sentry)
- [ ] Performance monitoring
- [ ] User analytics
- [ ] Health checks
